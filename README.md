# Suspect-Analysis-HTV4
An NLP-based web app which can be used by HR departments, and the police, to generate a character analysis based on a person's social media handle. 

## Description
The suspect analysis tool aims to help identify the behavior of a social media user based on their posts. This tool is meant to be used as an aid by law enforcement authorities to identify and monitor behavior of potential suspects. Using the natural language processing API from google cloud, we are able to categorize the persons behavior from their posts in six different categories; Love, like, cordial, annoyed, hate, dislike. Based on these categories we can identify a suspects psychological state and generate a report.

#### Our primary goal is to provide enable individuals, with Alzheimer's, with what they need to become more integrated in society.
